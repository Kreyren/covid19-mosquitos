**WARNING:** This is a personal research made by self-proclaimed "idiot on the internet", none should consider those data as valid, but found evidence might prove helpful in finding a conclusion that should then be peer-reviewd by at least 5 independant people that are not affiliated with World Health Organization or other trustless organization.

# covid-19-mosquito

Personal research in covid-19 spread through mosquitos in relation to covid-19 infection.

### Premise

Based on currently theoretical and unverified data mosquitos could carry SARS-CoV-2 that might be able to cause covid-19 in a human and in [felidae family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae) (?).

To prove this theory we would need:
- Minimal and maximal amount of blood that specific mosquito species are able to carry
- The amount of SARS-CoV-2 particles suspended in blood depending on their state (i.e are those particles trying to reproduce, are they inactive, etc..) 

Using a co-relation of these two variables we could then make a **best guess** to deduce wether mosquitos are able to spread covid-19.

Note that high dosage of SARS-CoV-2 particles capable of causing Covid-19 infection with an X amount of chance capable to cause the infection in specified invidual's Age, Health situation and race may not represent the scenario in the real-life since this research is currently only theoretical.

### Relevant data:
- Mosquitos are known to cause zika virus(?)
